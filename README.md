## 🧠 What I Learned

Implementing this portfolio was a great opportunity to refine my skills and explore new technologies from a senior perspective. Key takeaways include:

- **Senior-Level Architecture & Best Practices:** Focused on creating a highly maintainable and scalable codebase by implementing a robust **Internationalization (i18n)** system, applying advanced **SEO** techniques (semantic HTML, structured data), and strictly following **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles for maximum code reusability.
- **Modern SSG Frameworks (Astro):** Deepened my expertise in **Astro** to build a high-performance static site, leveraging its zero-JS-by-default architecture and component-driven model to achieve superior speed and SEO.
- **DevOps & CI/CD Automation:** Architected a seamless delivery pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process to **GitHub Pages**, ensuring a reliable and efficient release cycle.
- **Utility-First Styling & Asset Optimization:** Leveraged **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and maintainable UI development. Additionally, refined my skills in **Custom SVG Manipulation**, directly editing SVG files to ensure crisp, resolution-independent visuals and optimized performance.
